Overview
========

**oHySEM** provides a robust framework for optimizing hybrid energy systems, incorporating renewable electricity and hydrogen networks. The library is designed for users needing advanced tools for integrated resource planning, asset integration, system scheduling, and market participation in electricity and hydrogen markets.

Key Applications:
-----------------

- **Optimal Planning & Scheduling**: Ensure efficient energy resource management in hybrid systems.
- **Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)**: Plan long-term energy strategies integrating multiple energy sources.
- **Market Participation**: Engage in real-time electricity markets and future hydrogen markets.
- **Asset Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate new assets (e.g., renewable generators, storage units) into the system.
- **Self-scheduling**: Operation planning of the hybrid system. 

---

Features
========

- **Hybrid System Modeling**: Simulate and optimize the interaction between renewable electricity and hydrogen systems.
- **Market Integration**: Enable systems to participate in energy markets and optimize based on market conditions.
- **Asset Integration**: Support dynamic integration of new energy assets into the system.
- **Grid and Stand-alone Systems**: Model systems that are either grid-connected or self-sufficient.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for small- to large-scale hybrid power plants and virtual power plants (VPPs).

Installation
============

Install **oHySEM** using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ohysem

Alternatively, clone the GitHub repository and install it manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ohysem.git
    cd oHySEM
    pip install .

Getting Started
===============

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to create and run an optimization model using oHySEM:

.. code-block:: python

    import oHySEM as oH

    # Define your hybrid system
    system = oH.HybridSystem()

    # Add energy assets
    system.add_asset(oH.SolarPlant(capacity=100))  # 100 MW solar plant
    system.add_asset(oH.HydrogenStorage(capacity=50))  # 50 MWh hydrogen storage

    # Define market participation and scheduling parameters
    market = oH.MarketParticipation()
    scheduler = oH.Scheduler(system, market)

    # Run optimization
    results = scheduler.optimize()

    # Display results
    print(results)

This example shows how to create a basic hybrid system, integrate assets, and run an optimization for market participation and scheduling.

API Reference
=============

The API gives users full flexibility in defining, integrating, and optimizing hybrid systems. The following are key components:

``HybridSystem()``
    - Purpose: Represents the hybrid energy system, including both electricity and hydrogen networks.
    - Methods: add_asset(), optimize(), schedule(), etc.

``MarketParticipation()``
    - Purpose: Represents the system's participation in electricity and hydrogen markets.
    - Methods: define_market_conditions(), participate(), etc.

``Scheduler()``
    - Purpose: Optimizes the hybrid system's operation based on system constraints and market signals.
    - Methods: optimize(), get_results()

Please refer to the full API documentation for more detailed usage and advanced configurations.
