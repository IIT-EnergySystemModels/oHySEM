“*Simplicity and Transparency in Energy Systems Planning*”

**oHySEM** is a multi-stage stochastic optimization model for the optimal operation scheduling of a Hydrogen-based Virtual Power Plant (H-VPP), which contains hydrogen-based energy storage systems (ESS), renewable energy sources (RES), and battery energy storage systems (BESS).

The model has been developed at the `Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica (IIT) <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/index.php.en>`_ of
the `Universidad Pontificia Comillas <https://www.comillas.edu/en/>`_.
