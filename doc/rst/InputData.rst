====================  =============================================================================================================  =========

A time step greater than one hour it is a convenient way to reduce the load levels of the time scope. The moving average of the demand, upward/downward operating reserves, variable generation/consumption/storage and ESS energy inflows/outflows
over the time step load levels is assigned to active load levels (e.g., the mean value of the three hours is associated to the third hour in a trihourly time step).

Period
------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Period.csv`` follows:

==============  ============  =====================
Identifier      Header        Description
==============  ============  =====================
Period          Weight        Weight of each period
==============  ============  =====================

This weight allows the definition of equivalent (representative) years (e.g., year 2030 with a weight of 5 would represent years 2030-2034). Periods are not mathematically connected between them with operation constraints, i.e., no constraints link the operation
at different periods. However, they are linked by the investment decisions, i.e., investments made in a year remain installed for the rest of the years.

Scenario
--------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Scenario.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  ============  ===========================================  ====
Identifiers                     Header        Description
==============================  ============  ===========================================  ====
Period          Scenario        Probability   Probability of each scenario in each period  p.u.
==============  ==============  ============  ===========================================  ====

For example, the scenarios can be used for obtaining the IRP (GEP+SEP+TEP) considering hydro energy/water inflows uncertainty represented by means of three scenarios (wet, dry and average), or two VRES scenarios (windy/cloudy and calm/sunny).
The sum of the probabilities of all the scenarios of a period must be 1.

Stage
-----

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Stage.csv`` follows:

==============  ============  =====================
Identifier      Header        Description
==============  ============  =====================
Scenario        Weight        Weight of each stage
==============  ============  =====================

This weight allows the definition of equivalent (representative) periods (e.g., one representative week with a weight of 52 or four representative weeks each one with a weight of 13).
Stages are not mathematically connected between them, i.e., no constraints link the operation at different stages. Consequently, the storage type can't exceed the duration of the stage (i.e., if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage type can only be hourly or daily).

Adequacy reserve margin
-----------------------

The adequacy reserve margin is the ratio between the available capacity and the maximum demand.
According to ENTSO-e, adequacy is defined as the ability of the electric system to supply the aggregate electrical demand and energy requirements of the customers at all times,
taking into account scheduled and reasonably expected unscheduled outages of system elements.
For determining the available capacity, the model uses the availability of the generating units times their maximum power. The availability can be computed as the ratio between the firm capacity and the installed capacity. Firm capacity
can be determined as the Firm Capacity Equivalent (FCE) or the Effective Load-Carrying Capability (ELCC).
A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_ReserveMargin.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  =============  ==========================================================  ====
Identifiers                     Header         Description
==============================  =============  ==========================================================  ====
Period          Area            ReserveMargin  Minimum adequacy reserve margin for each period and area    p.u.
==============  ==============  =============  ==========================================================  ====

This parameter is only used for system generation expansion, not for the system operation. If no value is introduced for an area, the reserve margin is considered 0.

Maximum CO2 emission
--------------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Emission.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  =============  ======================================================================  =====
Identifiers                     Header         Description
==============  ==============  =============  ======================================================================  =====
Period          Area            CO2Emission    Maximum CO2 emission of the electric system for each period and area    MtCO2
==============  ==============  =============  ======================================================================  =====

If no value is introduced for an area, the CO2 emission limit is considered infinite.

Minimum RES energy
------------------

It is like a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).
A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_RESEnergy.csv`` follows:

==============  ==============  =============  ===========================================================  =====
Identifiers                     Header         Description
==============================  =============  ===========================================================  =====
Period          Area            RESEnergy      Minimum RES energy for each period and area                  GWh
==============  ==============  =============  ===========================================================  =====

If no value is introduced for an area, the RES energy limit is considered 0.

Duration
--------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Duration.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ========== ==========  ===================================================================  ========
Identifiers                            Header      Description
====================================== ==========  ===================================================================  ========
Period      Scenario        Load level Duration    Duration of the load level. Load levels with duration 0 are ignored  h
                                       Stage       Assignment of the load level to a stage
==========  ==============  ========== ==========  ===================================================================  ========

It is a simple way to use isolated snapshots or representative days or just the first three months instead of all the hours of a year to simplify the optimization problem. All the load levels must have the same duration.
The duration is not intended to change for the several load levels of an stage. Usually, duration is put as 1 hour or 0 if you want not to use the load levels after some hour of the year. The parameter time step must be used to collapse consecutive load levels into a single one for the optimization problem.

The stage duration as sum of the duration of all the load levels must be larger or equal than the shortest duration of any storage type or any outflows type or any energy type (all given in the generation data) and multiple of it.
Consecutive stages are not connected between them, i.e., no constraints link the operation at different stages. Consequently, the storage type can't exceed the duration of the stage (i.e., if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage type can only be hourly or daily).
Consequently, the objective function with several stages must be a bit higher than in the case of a single stage.

The initial storage of the ESSs is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage. For example, the initial storage level is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.

Electricity demand
------------------

A description of the data included in the file ``oT_Data_Demand.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ============================================  ==
Identifiers                             Header  Description
======================================  ======  ============================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Node    Power demand of the node for each load level  MW
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ============================================  ==

The electricity demand can be negative for the (transmission) nodes where there is (renewable) generation in lower voltage levels. This negative demand is equivalent to generate that power amount in this node.
Internally, all the values below if positive demand (or above if negative demand) 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

System inertia
--------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_Inertia.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ================================================  ==
Identifiers                             Header  Description
======================================  ======  ================================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Area    System inertia of the area for each load level    s
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ================================================  ==

Given that the system inertia depends on the area, it can be sensible to assign an area as a country, for example. The system inertia can be used for imposing a minimum synchronous power and, consequently, force the commitment of at least some rotating units.
Each generating unit can contribute to the system inertia. The system inertia is the sum of the inertia of all the committed units in the area.

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system electricity demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Upward and downward operating reserves
--------------------------------------

A description of the data included in the files ``oT_Data_OperatingReserveUp.csv`` and ``oT_Data_OperatingReserveDown.csv`` follows:

==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ===================================================================  ==
Identifiers                                     Header  Description
======================================  ======  ===================================================================  ==
Period      Scenario        Load level  Area    Upward/downward operating reserves of the area for each load level   MW
==========  ==============  ==========  ======  ===================================================================  ==

Given that the operating reserves depend on the area, it can be sensible to assign an area as a country, for example.
These operating reserves must include Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR) and Manual Frequency Restoration Reserves (mFRR) for electricity balancing from ENTSO-E.

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

The model allways considers a month of 672 hours, i.e., 4 weeks, not calendar months. The model considers a year of 8736 hours, i.e., 52 weeks, not calendar years.

Daily *storage type* means that the ESS inventory is assessed every time step. For daily storage type it is assessed at the end of every hour, for weekly storage type it is assessed at the end of every day, monthly storage type is assessed at the end of every week, and yearly storage type is assessed at the end of every month.
*Outflows type* represents the interval when the energy extracted from the storage must be satisfied (for daily outflows type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the energy consumed must be equal to the sum of outflows for every day).
*Energy type* represents the interval when the minimum or maximum energy to be produced by a unit must be satisfied (for daily energy type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the energy generated by the unit must be lower/greater to the sum of max/min energy for every day).
The *storage cycle* is the minimum between the inventory assessment period (defined by the storage type), the outflows period (defined by the outflows type), and the energy period (defined by the energy type) (only if outflows or energy power values have been introduced).
It can be one time step, one day, one week, and one month, but it can't exceed the stage duration. For example, if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage cycle can only be hourly or daily.

The initial storage of the ESSs is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage, only if the initial inventory lies between the storage limits. For example, the initial storage level is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.

A generator with operation cost (sum of the fuel and emission cost, excluding O&M cost) > 0 is considered a non-renewable unit. If the unit has no operation cost and its maximum storage = 0,
it is considered a renewable unit. If its maximum storage is > 0, with or without operation cost, is considered an ESS.

A very small variable O&M cost (not below 0.01 โฌ/MWh, otherwise it will converted to 0 by the model) for the ESS can be used to avoid pumping with avoided curtailment (at no cost) and afterwards being discharged as spillage.

Must-run non-renewable units are always committed, i.e., their commitment decision is equal to 1. All must-run units are forced to produce at least their minimum output.

EFOR is used to reduce the maximum and minimum power of the unit. For hydropower plants it can be used to reduce their maximum power by the water head effect. It does not reduce the maximum charge.

Those generators or ESS with fixed cost > 0 are considered candidate and can be installed or not.

Maximum, minimum, and initial storage values are considered proportional to the invested capacity for the candidate ESS units if StorageInvestment is activated.

If lower and upper bounds of investment/retirement decisions are very close (with a difference < 1e-3) to 0 or 1 are converted into 0 and 1.

Variable maximum and minimum generation

This information can be used for considering scheduled outages or weather-dependent operating capacity.

To force a generator to produce 0 a lower value (e.g., 0.1 MW) strictly > 0, but not 0 (in which case the value will be ignored), must be introduced. This is needed to limit the solar production at night, for example.
It can be used also for upper-bounding and/or lower-bounding the output of any generator (e.g., run-of-the-river hydro, wind).

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

To force a ESS to consume 0 a lower value (e.g., 0.1 MW) strictly > 0, but not 0 (in which case the value will be ignored), must be introduced.
It can be used also for upper-bounding and/or lower-bounding the consumption of any ESS (e.g., pumped-hydro storage, battery).

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Variable fuel cost

If you have daily energy inflows data just input the daily amount at the first hour of every day if the ESS have daily or weekly storage capacity.

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Energy inflows are considered proportional to the invested capacity for the candidate ESS units if StorageInvestment is activated.

Energy outflows

==========  ==============  ==========  =========  =============================  =====

All the generators must be defined as columns of these files.

These energy outflows can be used to represent the electric energy extracted from an ESS to produce H2 from electrolyzers, to move EVs, to produce heat, or as hydro outflows for irrigation.
The use of these outflows is incompatible with the charge of the ESS within the same time step (as the discharge of a battery is incompatible with the charge in the same hour).

If you have hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly outflows data, you can just input the hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly amount at the first hour of every day/week/month/year.

Internally, all the values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Initial and final node are the nodes where the transmission line starts and ends, respectively. They must be different.

Depending on the voltage lines are plotted with different colors (orange < 200 kV, 200 < green < 350 kV, 350 < red < 500 kV, 500 < orange < 700 kV, blue > 700 kV).

If there is no data for TTCBck, i.e., TTCBck is left empty or is equal to 0, it is substituted by the TTC in the code. Internally, all the TTC and TTCBck values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Reactance can take a negative value as a result of the approximation of three-winding transformers. No Kirchhoff's second law disjunctive constraint is formulated for a circuit with negative reactance.

Those lines with fixed cost > 0 are considered candidate and can be installed or not.

If lower and upper bounds of investment decisions are very close (with a difference < 1e-3) to 0 or 1 are converted into 0 and 1.

The model allways considers a month of 672 hours, i.e., 4 weeks, not calendar months. The model considers a year of 8736 hours, i.e., 52 weeks, not calendar years.

Daily *storage type* means that the ESS inventory is assessed every time step, for weekly storage type it is assessed at the end of every day, monthly storage type is assessed at the end of every week, and yearly storage type is assessed at the end of every month.
*Outflows type* represents the interval when the water extracted from the reservoir must be satisfied (for daily outflows type at the end of every day, i.e., the sum of the water consumed must be equal to the sum of water outflows for every day).
The *storage cycle* is the minimum between the inventory assessment period (defined by the storage type), the outflows period (defined by the outflows type), and the energy period (defined by the energy type) (only if outflows or energy power values have been introduced).
It can be one time step, one day, one week, and one month, but it can't exceed the stage duration. For example, if the stage lasts for 168 hours the storage cycle can only be hourly or daily.

The initial reservoir volume is also fixed at the beginning and end of each stage, only if the initial volume lies between the reservoir storage limits. For example, the initial volume is set for the hour 8736 in case of a single stage or for the hours 4368 and 4369
(end of the first stage and beginning of the second stage) in case of two stages, each with 4368 hours.

All the reservoirs must be defined as columns of these files.

For example, these data can be used for defining the operating guide (rule) curves for the hydro reservoirs.

Hydrogen System Input Data
==========================

These input files are specifically introduced for allowing a representation of the hydrogen energy vector to supply hydrogen demand produced with electricity or by any other means through the hydrogen network.
If the hydrogen is only produced from electricity and there is not hydrogen transfer among nodes the hydrogen demand can be represented by the energy outflows associated to the unit (i.e., electrolyzer).

Initial and final node are the nodes where the transmission line starts and ends, respectively. They must be different.

If there is no data for TTCBck, i.e., TTCBck is left empty or is equal to 0, it is substituted by the TTC in the code. Internally, all the TTC and TTCBck values below 1e-5 times the maximum system demand of each area will be converted into 0 by the model.

Those pipelines with fixed cost > 0 are considered candidate and can be installed or not.

If lower and upper bounds of investment decisions are very close (with a difference < 1e-3) to 0 or 1 are converted into 0 and 1.

Heat System Input Data
======================

These input files are specifically introduced for allowing a representation of the heat energy vector to supply heat demand produced with electricity or with any fuel through the heat network.
If the heat is only produced from electricity and there is not heat transfer among nodes the heat demand can be represented by the energy outflows associated to the unit (i.e., heat pump or electric boiler).
